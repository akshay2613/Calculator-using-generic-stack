Designed a generic calculator that
takes as input an expression and evaluates as outputs
the answer.
Use self implemented generic stack. No STL
allowed.
Terminology: Generic stack= A single expression can
contain both int,double and the answer should be
accordingly.
Example: 1. Input : (4+5)/6*3
Output : 4.5
2. Input: (4+5.6)/3.2+(4+3.888) Output: 10.888Operations to be implemented: Addition, Subtraction,
Multiplication, Division and Modulo
Clarifications : The input given will be a correct
mathematical statement with matching brackets(if any).
You need not worry about Negative numbers as we
haven’t mentioned unary – operator.
Evaluation parameters: Output correctness, Accuracy
of operations and performance.
